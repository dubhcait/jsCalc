## This was a precourse Task for FAC:

Build a calculator. This is one of the "Advanced Front End Development Projects" on Free Code Camp.

Rather than using Codepen or JS Fiddle, you should do this directly with your text editor, terminal and browser. 
Start by creating your repo on GitHub and try to stick to the command line for adding, 
committing and pushing your changes as you go.

Make sure to host your project on GitHub pages. Remember, no frameworks
